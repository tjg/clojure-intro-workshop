# Clojure Introduction

In this workshop, we create a game which combines simple rules to
create complexity.  Modelled on life, this game's rules were inspired by
[birth, death and
survival](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdMzngWchDk).

This repo contains:

- a starter-kit for programming the [Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).
- examples which you can mold to your ends.




## Under remodeling

If you look at the curent code, pretty graphics are missing. Not to
worry — we're just trying out new ideas based on what people had
trouble with during the last workshop.




## Install

- `git clone git@github.com:adcloud/clojure-intro-workshop.git`
- Install [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/).
- Somewhere under the project folder, run `lein deps`
- You can start an interactive repl with `lein repl`



## Let's start!

- Open [`src/clojure_intro_workshop/core.clj`](https://github.com/adcloud/clojure-intro-workshop/blob/master/src/clojure_intro_workshop/core.clj).
- Read the [rules of Game of
  Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). (Or play by
  your own rules, if you prefer.)




## Cheat sheets

- This workshop's cheat sheets: [basics](https://github.com/adcloud/clojure-intro-workshop/blob/master/patterns_page_1.clj), [concurrency](https://github.com/adcloud/clojure-intro-workshop/blob/master/patterns_page_2.clj).
